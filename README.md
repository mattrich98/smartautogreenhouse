<h1>Industry Week Project: Smart Automated Greenhouse System</h1>
As part of the software development bootcamp curriculum, each of us is tasked with creating a project that demonstrates an automated greenhouse. (I misunderstood the assignment, it was meant to be group work)

<hr>
<strong><u>Plans:</u></strong>
<ol>
<li><s>Basic layout done</s></li>
<li><s> Buttons that have booleans for true and false</s></li>
<li>Sunlight simulator, <s>maybe using math.random method </s>(Maybe I'll make simulators for cold day, hot day, very hot day, mild day with pressable buttons, this may adjust the sunlight throughout a specific number of time/ticks, in conjunction with a timer for 24/48 seconds, representing 24 hours in a day(maybe 2 ticks per hour for 48)) </li>
<li>parallel system that implements how variables effect each other and other numbers/etc. (Using if/else/elseif statements) </li>
<li>Temperature simulator, it is effected by other variables</li>
  <li><s>Before the image output box, to let the user know that the bottom four buttons are activated, each will become green once set to True</s></li>
<li>Image output box area on top that demonstrates the changes, (To save time I may: Make a seperate image for each iteration of the greenhouse (windows open/closed etc), this will change according to which link is used.) (Sun can be added with position: absolute)</li>
<li><s>Output box (Not completely necessary as I will have an image output box; but I will see when I get around to it)</s> It will be an instructions box</li>
</ol> 
<hr>
<ul> 
<li>I wanted to practice implenting 'for' and 'while' loops, but ended up not using them because it was too complicated and just served as an additional feature.</li>
<li>However, while trying to implement these loops, I've become a little more familiar with them and understand how to make use of them.</li>
<li>Within for loops, and many other things, to do complicated instructions, you have to nest a lot of code within eachother. </li>
<li>Regarding setTimeout being asynchronous, I could also look into requestAnimationFrame() maybe, </li>
