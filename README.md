<h1>Industry Week Project: Smart Automated Greenhouse System</h1>

As part of the software development bootcamp curriculum, we are tasked to each make a project that demonstrates a greenhouse
that can grow a plant under specific conditions related with temperature, windows open/closed and other.

I plan to use HTMl, CSS and Javascript to create the project as I am more comfortable with that compared to Python.
