<strong><u>Plans:</u></strong>
<ol>
<li><s>Basic layout done</s></li>
<li><s> Buttons that have booleans for true and false</s></li>
<li>Sunlight simulator, maybe using math.random method</li>
<li>parallel system that implements how variables effect each other and other numbers/etc. (Using if/else/elseif statements) </li>
<li>Temperature simulator, it is effected by other variables</li>
<li>Output box (Not completely necessary but I will see when I get around to it</li>

- I wanted to practice implenting 'for' and 'while' loops, but ended up not using them because it was too complicated and just served as an additional feature.
- However, while trying to implement these loops, I've become a little more familiar with them and understand how to make use of them.
