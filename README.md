<h1>Industry Week Project: Smart Automated Greenhouse System</h1>

As part of the software development bootcamp curriculum, we are tasked to each make a project that demonstrates a greenhouse
that can grow a plant under specific conditions related with temperature, windows open/closed and other.

I plan to use HTMl, CSS and Javascript to create the project as I am more comfortable with that compared to Python.

Adjustable environmental factors:
Temperature, humidity, light, soil moisture. (4 SENSORS) 

Fans/Vents, Windows, LED Lights, Heater, Water Pump(Sprinklers/Valves),  (4/5 ADJUSTABLES)
(^ Crops are affected by the above ^)
